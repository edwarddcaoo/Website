										<p>A group project created through the ENSC 100W Course; We had the goal of making it easier for staff/students to find available parking spots, especially at designated SFU Parking lots. I focused on the research area, in which I analyzed and identified the best components to use to achieve our vision.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Real-Time Parking Availability Camera</h3>
											<p>This project was the final deliverable for my ENSC 100W course. Within a team of 8, our goal was to develop a program that would tell us if a parking spot was available, thus reducing the time staff and students would spend searching for one. I focused on the research part, in which I analyzed and identified the best possible equipment that would be able to withstand even the toughest weather conditions.</p>

											<h3 class="major">EWB UBC Biomedical Engineering Case Competition</h3>
											<p>This device was created to accomodate those with muscular dystrophy to participate in a variety of sports. In a team of 5, we all contributed to the design and development of the prototype, ensuring that it would meet all necessary criteria. Examples of criteria were: a price under $100, able to accommodate different ball sizes, and be easily transportable and storable without hindering the user's mobility.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Sumo Bot</h3>
											<p>This was an individual project that would later be used to compete against other students in my Robotics class. The goal was to create a robot that could not only defend itself from attacks, but also be able to knock out its opponents. The wooden controller was programmed to whatever was desired, in my case, I included mechanisms that would only activate when all four levers were pressed.</p>
